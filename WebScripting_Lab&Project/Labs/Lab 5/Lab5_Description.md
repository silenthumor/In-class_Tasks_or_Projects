# **Lab Description**
1. Take the HTML page that accompanies this PDF doc (Lab5.html) and rename it for use with this exercise. For example: “Jim_Lab5.html”.

2. The purpose of this lab is to use DHTML practices to insert all of the controls found in the original solution to Lab #4, into the Lab #5 HTML page using JavaScript.

3. In this case, you’ll be inserting everything into the \<div> container called “container” which has already been created for you in the body of the web page.

4. An “onload” event handler (“initControls()”) has been added as well, to the JavaScript code section and you should use this function exclusively to create all the web page controls.

5. When you have the UI displaying correctly, don’t forget to test the full functionality of the page controls.
