Open the index.html and about.html files provided.<p>Create an external css file (main.css) to recreate the layout below.  You may use either floats or positioning to create the three columns.  Add the link to the main.css in each html page. You should only have one css file for both pages.</p> </td>

<tr>
<td>Finish coding the Favourite Crafts section on the about page. <p> I have provided the images (fav1.jpg, fav2.jpg and fav3.jpg).  The "here" link for each craft can be a dummy link. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In the nav, add a link to the about Jude page on the index.html file and add a link to the index page on the about.html page. <p>Add a link to  your email address in the Contact Jude column on the about page. <p>Change all the Jude's to your own name.</td></tr>
<tr>

<td>The index and about pages were coded using html5 elements. Remember to account for older browsers that render these new elements as inline at the top of the css file. I have already included the link to the script for older versions of IE.</td>
