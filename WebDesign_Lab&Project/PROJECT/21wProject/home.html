                    Life is hard to be as durable and amazing as Barcelona, and few Real Madrid can always get what they want. Life is not waiting for the future forever like Arsenal, nor can it always miss the past like Liverpool, nor can it rely on the rich like Chelsea and Manchester City. Life can only fight like Manchester United! Fight, advance, don't give up, reverse, lore! The bragging 20 years ago has now been realized, and it has really pulled Liverpool from the throne! This is the spirit of Manchester United, this is the belief of the Red Devils. Watching the Manchester United game, I feel my blood is burning.

                    "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before." --- Jacob A. Riis (May 3, 1849 - May 26, 1914)

                    Jacob A. Riis is one of the most famous American photojournalists in the last century. Of course, at the time of his death, the NBA had not yet been born, but this did not hinder Gregg Popovich's appreciation of Riis, especially his famous saying, which perfectly fits the Spurs' team philosophy. The way the Spurs succeed is not mysterious, it is to repeat the job every day and persevere. They will not feel boring, because they know the importance of the first 100 hits.
