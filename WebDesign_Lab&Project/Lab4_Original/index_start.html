            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>There are 4 basic design principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The principle of
                <strong>contrast</strong> states that if something is different make them really different. Make them stand out so it draws attention. Can create contrast with color, fonts, sizes, whitespace etc.
            </p>
            <p>The principle of
                <strong>repetition</strong> states that you repeat some aspect of the design with the purpose to unify and add visual interest. The repetitive element can be a font, a bullet, a line, colour, design element, spatial relationship etc.  Repetition creates consistency.
            </p>
            <p>The
                <strong>alignment</strong> principle states that nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. The goal is to unify and organize. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.
            </p>
            <p>The principle of
                <strong>proximity</strong> states that you group related elements together. Move items close to each other so they are seen as one unit.  It implies a relationship and creates a path for eye to follow.

            <ul>
                <li>Covers not just deaf and blind but limited mobility, slow dialup, different devices</li>
                <li> Use alt attributes on images</li>
                <li>Use text that makes sense when read out of context</li>
                <li>Use semantic markup</li>
                <li>separate content from presentation to reduce amount of code in html file</li>
                <li> Make sure color alone is not used to convey meaning</li>
                <li>Ensure line by line reading of any tables makes sense</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- SEO Search Engine Optimization -->
        <section id="seo">
            <h2>SEO</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Validate your site</strong> - makes it easier for search engines to read your pages, search engines read page line by line and if there are errors can prevent spider from reading the content. 	Valid html  tends to lessen the amount of code on the page
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use <strong>alt attributes</strong> on images so search engine understands what image is about. Create unique relevant description of image being described. Never repeat same alt tags unless its same image. Use keywords in your descriptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is necessary to <strong>clearly set the theme</strong> , purpose and content of the network. According to different purposes to locate website characteristics, the theme of the website must be clear and prominent, and the content must be rich and full, in accordance with the principle of user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <strong>keywords</strong>  of the website are very important. The choice of keywords must be prominent and related to the theme of the website. Emphasis should be placed on embodying keywords in Page Title and Heading.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In order to better realize the dialogue with search engines, if a website can be <strong>updated regularly</strong> , it will be easier for search engines to include it. Therefore, a reasonable update of the website is also an important method of search engine optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Generally, the homepage file of the website should be placed in the root directory of the website. There should <strong>not be too many subdirectories</strong> . The first-level directory should not exceed two levels, and the detailed directory should not exceed four levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Use plain text  for website navigation</strong>  as much as possible, because text conveys more information than pictures.
                </li>
