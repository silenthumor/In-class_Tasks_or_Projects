<h2>LAB 4 - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
<p>The final lab consists of 4 parts:</p>
<p>  1. using a google font for the h1 and h2
  <br />
  2. finishing the navigation links<br />
  3. creating the navigation with transition on the hover<br />
  4. researching 5 SEO tips and including them in the page</p>
<p>The lab is out of 10 marks<br />
  1 mark for implementing the h1 and h2 font<br />
  1 mark for the nav links working<br />
3 marks for the navigation styling, hover and transition<br />
5 marks for 5 SEO tips.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<p>For the navigation, feel free to be creative and use your own colors and fonts etc.  If you wish to duplicate the navigation below I used the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Anton font</li>
  <li>#333 for the h1, h2 and section link colors</li>
  <li>use approximate, relative font sizes</li>
  <li>I used a border-top on the nav li</li>
  <li>I used a border-bottom on the last li by using nav li:last-child</li>
  <li>I created my nav transition and hover on the li, not the a tag </li>
  <li>I changed the background color and padding to get the hover effect, the darker background color was #496B87</li>
  <li>I coded the first two nav links for you so you can see how I did it. I also coded the back to top links.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SEO (search engine optimization) Tips:</strong></p>
<p>What are some   things a web designer could do when designing and developing a site to   improve organic (free) search engine rankings. <strong>Research</strong> and come   up with a list of ideas you could use. I have provided a couple and we   have discussed some in class throughout the semester. Add your list of   ideas to the seo section of the page.  Include a link to your sources if   necessary.  Please make sure your ideas are in your own words and not   copied and pasted from other websites.  You should have five suggestions   of your own for a total of seven. We will discuss SEO in our next class. </p>
