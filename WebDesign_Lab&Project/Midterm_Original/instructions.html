          <p class="style1">You must finish coding the html file and link it to an <strong>external stylesheet file</strong>. I have coded most of the html file for you - feel free to modify if you wish. You need to finish the header with the h1, nav and banner image.  Use HTML5 elements where possible. Save your file as index.html and keep it in the folder that was downloaded and extracted.</p>
       <p class="style1">I have started the file using the HTML5 doctype. Make sure you address their display properties for older browsers.  I have included the script for older versions of IE in the html code also.   </p>          <p class="style1"> The second screenshot below shows what the html file should look like prior to any css styles applied.  It is there so you can see if your html page is coded correctly before you move on to adding styles.</p></td>
